## 🔍 Credit Scoring Business Understanding

As an analytics engineer at **Bati Bank**, a lending financial provider with over 10 years of experience, this project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of a credit scoring model in a real-world scenario. Bati Bank is partnering with an emerging eCommerce company to enable a Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) service, offering credit-based purchasing options for customers who meet eligibility criteria.

We use available data to build, validate, deploy, and automate a credit scoring model. Traditionally, credit scoring uses statistical techniques to assess borrower profiles and predict creditworthiness. Once trained, the model is used to evaluate new applicants based on the same features, outputting either a credit score or a binary default prediction.

Before diving into technical implementation, let’s define key financial concepts relevant to the fintech domain:

---

### 💳 Financial Terms

* **Credit**: The provision of loans or financing through technology-driven platforms.
* **Credit Scoring**: Assigning a quantitative score to estimate a borrower's likelihood of default.
* **Credit Risk**: The potential financial loss if a borrower fails to meet their obligations.

---

## 📊 Credit Risk Management

Credit risk management is crucial for maintaining financial stability. Under the **Basel II Capital Accord** (2004), qualifying institutions may use internally developed credit risk models under the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based (A-IRB) approach. This enables banks to:

* Replace regulatory fixed estimates with internally calibrated models.
* Use past behavioral and transactional data to assess risk.

A key innovation is transforming customer behavior into predictive insights. For instance, analyzing **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** patterns helps construct a **proxy for credit risk**, allowing us to train a supervised model that outputs a risk probability score. This score can be used to make informed credit decisions.

---

## 🌐 Basel II Requirements

To comply with Basel II, internal risk models must be:

* **Transparent** to regulators
* **Validatable** through documentation and reproducibility
* **Explainable** to stakeholders and oversight bodies

As a result, **interpretable models** such as logistic regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) encoding are often preferred. These models:

* Offer clear explanations for individual predictions
* Support compliance and audit requirements

---

## ❓ Why Use Proxy Variables?

In real-world scenarios, a direct "default" label is often unavailable due to:

* Incomplete or inconsistent reporting
* Absence of long-term repayment outcomes

We create **proxy targets** based on heuristics such as "90+ days past due within 12 months."

**Benefits**:

* Enables supervised learning

**Risks**:

* **Label noise** may degrade model performance
* **Proxy misalignment** can lead to biased or invalid business decisions
* Regulatory scrutiny if justification for proxy is weak

---

## ⚖️ Modeling Approaches

### Traditional Statistical Model

#### ● Logistic Regression

* **Purpose**: Estimates probability of default
* **Pros**:

  * High interpretability
  * Easy to deploy and validate
  * Friendly for regulatory environments
* **Cons**:

  * Assumes linearity
  * Limited ability to capture complex interactions

---

### Machine Learning Models

#### ● Decision Trees

* Rule-based classification (e.g., "Income > \$50K" ➔ "Age > 30")
* **Pros**: Easy to understand, captures non-linearity, handles mixed data types
* **Cons**: High variance, prone to overfitting

#### ● Random Forest

* Ensemble of decision trees
* **Pros**: High accuracy, robust to noise, less overfitting
* **Cons**: Harder to interpret, resource-intensive

#### ● Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

* Sequentially improves weak learners
* **Pros**: Often best-in-class performance
* **Cons**: High risk of overfitting, requires careful tuning, less interpretable
